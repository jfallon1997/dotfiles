# dotfiles

A (WIP) repo containing my dotfiles. Some of the files I use contain copy-pasted code from sources that I have long forgotten about, I will try and tidy this sort of thing up...

In setting up your own dotfiles repo, you may find [this guide](https://coderwall.com/p/ynu8xq/keep-your-dotfiles-in-git) useful.

## .bashrc

Based on the Debian default, I will swap this for a more customized version at some point.

## .bash_profile

Empty.

## .tmux.conf

Mostly code from Arch Wiki to enable a vim style experience. To be tidied up.

## .vimrc

Contains some useful macros, and a selection of common default options (syntax highlighting, line numbering, etc.). To be tidied up.
